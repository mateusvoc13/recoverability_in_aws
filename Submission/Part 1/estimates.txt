* Configuration availability

  Here we present you the estimate availability for the multi-AZ/multi-region
  configuration that was created in this project.

  In this case, the configuration contains:
  - Multi-AZ database in a primary region;
  - Read-replica in the secondary region.

  The outage scenarios that will be considered for the estimates are:
  - Single AZ outage;
  - Single Region outage;

  The parameters considered are:
  - RTO: Recovery time objective
  - RPO: Recovery Point objective

  Here are the estimates:
  - Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage:

    According to AWS, the failover times are typically 60â€“120 seconds for
    multi-AZ configurations and this is done automatically when there is an
    outage in the DB instance. For this reason, a minimum RTO of *30 minutes*
    would be reasonable.

  - Minimum RTO for a single region outage

    For the region outage, the read replica would need to be used and
    promoted. The process of promoting the replica would either need to be
    automatized or be triggered by an operator. For this reason, the minimum RTO
    in the current configuration would be *1 hour*.

  - Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage and for a single region outage

    For the RPO, the rationale is similar but the values a little different. For
    RDS, the RPO is typically around 5 minutes. For this reason, a safe RTO for
    the single AZ outage would be *20 minutes* while for the region outage *1
    hour*.
